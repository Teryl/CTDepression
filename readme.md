## Project Summary

### Start Screen

### Win Condition
### Effectiveness and Results

## Concepts
Any ideas that were deemed unfeasible or reserved for 'later' goes here. Not like we're gonna do anything after this is over but still just for documentation purposes.

## Snippets and Dependencies (native)
Use for showcasing code snippets copied from external sources (*ahem* stack overflow), sort of like a bibliography, just dump shit here haha we can figure out later.
Mainly to avoid the problem of plagiarism.
